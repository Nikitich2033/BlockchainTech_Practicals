    "# 1. What is Blockchain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although blockchain has a variety of definitions, a blockchain can best be described as a data structure of blocks that are chained together to form a collection of records, called a ledger, with cryptography being a key ingredient in the process. A blockchain doesn't have a storage mechanism; instead, it has a set of protocols that govern the way in which information is forged. So, a blockchain can be stored in flat files or in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchain technology gained popularity due to the fact that its integrity can't easily be compromised. A compromised blockchain can be recognized for what it is, and rejected quite easily by anyone in a network. This integrity is achieved by cryptography, which is what binds the blocks together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchain's promise of providing such robust integrity is what eventually paved the way for the idea of sharing chains of data in untrusted peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Validation of the blocks in a blockchain is what makes sure that a blockchain has a valid global state that can be accepted by everyone. Due to a blockchain's ability to share information in an open P2P network without any central authority governing it, the technology can have many different applications; however, the technology could not simply just be deployed to these applications immediately without any troubleshooting. Although blockchain technology, from the beginning, had a huge role to play in the decentralization of applications, it still faced several challenges with regards to its application in trustless environments. One of the biggest challenges was keeping a blockchain consistent across all the participants of a P2P network. This was solved by creating a consensus algorithm, which agrees on how the blocks should be appended to grow the chain in a trustless environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term blockchain actually entails a number of concepts, including P2P network management, consensus mechanism, and more, all contributing to the creation of a decentralized application.\n",

    "A Blockchain network essentially manages a `decentralized database`. The concept was first described in 2009 [in a cryptography blog](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) by a person or group of persons with the pseudonym `“Satoshi Nakamoto.”` Nakamoto proposed an  innovative peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic currency called Bitcoin that would enable online payments to be transferred directly from sender to recipient without an intermediary [(NAKAMOTO 2008)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). \n",

These servers operate under the rule that interactions are only made by servers permanently following rules of the protocols. Intermediaries (e.g., banks, clearing houses, trading platforms, centralized service providers, etc.) are hence no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of blockchains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Private blockchain (Permissioned)`: only authorized entities can hold a copy of the ledger or participate in transactions. Here, the nodes know each other, at least to a certain degree. The consensus process is either controlled by a group of known participants ( within conglomerates) or by a single participant (e.g., a company or a governmental agency), which adds some degree of centralization. E.g. [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/), [iota](https://www.iota.org/), and [ripple](https://ripple.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Private blockchains are suitable for organizations where a ledger only needs to be shared internally. Permissioned blockchains are often mutable or not strictly immutable, and their transactions can be modified with some effort; this is in stark contrast to public blockchains, where this is nearly impossible. Permissioned blockchains are still decentralized ledgers, but they will have some nodes with limited capability within the organization, whereas nodes in public blockchains are treated impartially.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Public blockchain (Permission-less)`: Permission-less Blockchain networks (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) are open to everyone. Anyone  may become a ledger node (i.e., hold a copy of the ledger) and add valid transaction entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Consortium blockchain`: a hybrid blockchain that is semi-decentralized. It combines the best features of both permissionless and permissioned blockchains. Instead of assigning most tasks to a single organization, a consortium blockchain assigns the same tasks to nodes maintained by multiple organizations. Instead of having a single validator node, there can be multiple nodes. Although a consortium blockchain is permissioned, it's more decentralized than a private blockchain. E.g.

    "If we consider a blockchain as a data structure, then the `blocks` are aggregated sets of data that are used for formation of the blockchain. *Blockchain formation is similar to linked list formation, where each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence*. In the case of blockchain, each `block` has a reference to the previous node, thus forming a link all the way to the initial block (known as the `genesis block`) of the chain.\n",

This era is widely known as the era of blockchain 2.0. `Namecoin` was one of the first concepts to emerge. It expanded the scope of Bitcoin's blockchain and was introduced as a distributed naming system based on Bitcoin. However, unlike Bitcoin, it was able to store data as **key-value pairs** in the public blockchain. This concept influenced a number of blockchain 2.0 applications that would go on to gain popularity.  \n",

    "As we can see, the hashing function makes history tampering hard, but not too hard. Even if we have a blockchain that consists of 1000 blocks, it would be trivial to alter the content of the first block and change the 999 parent hashes on the other blocks with recent computers. So, to ensure that bad people cannot alter the history (or at least make it very hard), we distribute this append-only database to everyone who wants to keep it (let's call them miners). Say there are ten miners. In this case, you cannot just alter the blockchain in your copy because the other nine miners who would scold, saying something like *hey, our records say history A but your record says B*. In this case, the majority wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, consensus is not just a case of choosing which blockchain has been chosen by the majority. The problem starts when we want to add a new block to the blockchain. Where do we start? How do we do it? The answer is that we broadcast. When we broadcast the candidate block that contains a new transaction, it will not reach every miner at the same time. You may reach the miner that stands beside you, but it will require time for your message to reach the miner that stands far away from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most miners want to get that reward we spoke of in the most efficient manner possible. To do this, they would get a new candidate block, work hard to find the answer in proof of work, and then add it to the longest chain as quickly as possible. But, why do they want to add it to the longest chain and not another chain? This is because it secures their reward."

If someone adds it to the blockchain that has three blocks, it is more likely to get discarded. Consequently, the reward would be taken away from the miner. The longest chain attracts the most miners anyway, and you want to be in the blockchain version that is kept by more people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some miners could persist in adding the block to the blockchain with three blocks, while other miners could also persist in adding the block to the blockchain with eight blocks. We call this a hard fork. Most of the time, miners will stick to the blockchain that has the longest chain.\n",

    "To change the history, an attacker will need to outgun at least more than 50% of the miners, which is impossible. The older the block, the more secure the history in that block is. Say one person needs 5 minutes to do the puzzle work. In this case, to replace the last five blocks in the blockchain, an attacker needs more than 25 minutes (because the attacker needs at least *six blocks to convince miners to replace the last five blocks in their blockchain*). \n",

    "But in those 25 minutes, other miners would keep adding new blocks to the **most popular blockchain**. So when 25 minutes have passed, the most popular blockchain would have gained an additional five blocks! Maybe the miners take a nap for an hour and don't add any more blocks. In this case, the attacker could accumulate six blocks to tamper with the most popular blockchain. However, the incentive embedded in the blockchain keeps the miners awake 24/7 as they want to get the reward as much as possible. Consequently, it's a losing battle for the attacker."

We’ll add some dummy data that we can change. Let’s introduce a new field in our block called nonce. A nonce is a number that we can keep on changing until we get a hash that satisfies our constraint. The nonce satisfying the constraint serves as proof that some computation has been performed.
